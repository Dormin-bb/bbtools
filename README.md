# bbtools
tools for parsing files for Blazblue's engine (P4A PS3/360, P4AU PS3, Blazblue Chronophantasma PC)


# The Goal

The goal here is analyze the game files of several games made by Arc System Works and produce a set of tools that produce useful information to players of the game, as well as document changes Arc System works has made to their engines over time for educational purposes.

# The Main Targets

* Blazblue: All versions (Original CT release all the way through the upcoming Central Fiction version)
* Persona 4 Arena and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax
* Guilty Gear Xrd and Guilty Gear Xrd: Revelator

# Secondary Targets

* Arcana Heart 3
* Dragon Ball Z: Extreme But≈çden 

Arcana Heart doesn't use bbscript, but it does use the same sprite format that ArcSys developed games uses.
The same may be true of Extreme Butoden. Might as well make the code for these tools flexible enough to dump information and sprites for those games too.
